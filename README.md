## Getting Started
Follow the below instructions to get started with the source code:
- [Make sure you have all Requirements](#requirements)
- [Download Source Code](#download)
- Run `npm install`, then `npm run start` and enjoy!

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the below requirements before starting:
- Node.js and npm (Node.js package manager)
- Basic Knowledge about javascript, html and nodejs

## Download
You can get access to the source code by using one of the following ways:
- :sparkles: Download Source Code
- :fire: Clone the repository locally:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/germanfica/material3-web.git
```

## Installation
1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Run npm install to install the project dependencies.

## Run

#### (1) Install the dependencies

```shell
npm install
```
This command fetches the libraries and other necessary files listed in package.json to run the application.

#### (2) Start the application

```shell
npm run start
```

This command will bundle your frontend assets using Rollup and then start the Express server. The frontend is accessible via http://localhost:3000 by default.

## Add Material components
If you wish to add more Material 3 components:

1- Open the `index.js` file.
2- Import the new components at the top of the file as shown below:

After adding new imports, remember to re-run npm run build to re-bundle the frontend or simply use npm run start to rebuild and restart the server.

## What is bundle.js?
`bundle.js`** is a single file that combines all your JavaScript code and necessary dependencies. It is generated by the bundling process, which makes your code understandable and loadable by web browsers. This is especially important for modern development tools, such as ES6 modules, which are not natively recognized by browsers.

When working with modern development tools such as ES6 modules, you often import modules using a syntax that is not directly recognized by browsers. For example, when you type **`import { something } from 'some-package'`**, the browser does not know how to find **`'some-package'`**. Rollup is a tool that takes all these modules and "packs" them into a single file (in this case **`bundle.js`**), resolving the module paths in a way that the browser can understand.
